# 30 Day JavaScript Coding Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the 30 Day JavaScript Coding Challenge! This repository contains solutions and my progress for the challenge organized by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). Each day, I will be completing a new JavaScript project or task to improve my skills and understanding of JavaScript.

## Day 1: Drum Kit

For the first day of the challenge, I created a drum kit application. This application allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. It's a fun and interactive way to learn about event listeners and audio manipulation in JavaScript.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure of the drum kit application. Each drum element is represented by a `<div>` with a data attribute for the corresponding key code.
  
- **CSS:** The CSS file styles the drum kit application, providing visual feedback when keys are pressed.
  
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript file adds event listeners to detect key presses and plays the corresponding drum sound when a key is pressed. It also handles animations to visually indicate which drum is being played.

## Day 2: JavaScript Clock

For the second day of the challenge, I created a JavaScript clock. This clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands rotating accordingly. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of how JavaScript can be used to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure of the clock, consisting of hour, minute, and second hands.
  
- **CSS:** The CSS file styles the clock, providing a visually appealing design with a background image and proper alignment of the clock hands.
  
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code updates the rotation of the clock hands every second to reflect the current time.


## Day 3: Scoped CSS Variables and JS

For the third day of the challenge, I created a project focusing on scoped CSS variables and JavaScript. This project demonstrates how CSS variables can be dynamically updated using JavaScript to manipulate properties such as spacing, blur, and background color of an image.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure of the project, including input elements for adjusting spacing, blur, and base color.
  
- **CSS:** The CSS file defines CSS variables for spacing, blur, and base color and applies them to an image.
  
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code adds event listeners to the input elements and dynamically updates the CSS variables based on user input.

## Day 4: Array Cardio ðŸ’ª

For the fourth day of the challenge, I worked on array manipulation exercises using built-in array functions in JavaScript. This project focuses on filtering, mapping, sorting, and reducing arrays to perform various operations.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains exercises using array methods such as filter, map, sort, and reduce to manipulate arrays of inventors and people's names.
