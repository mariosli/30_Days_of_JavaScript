# 30 Day JavaScript Coding Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the 30 Day JavaScript Coding Challenge! This repository contains solutions and my progress for the challenge organized by [Wes Bos](https://github.com/wesbos). Each day, I will be completing a new JavaScript project or task to improve my skills and understanding of JavaScript.

## Day 1: Drum Kit

For the first day of the challenge, I created a drum kit application. This application allows users to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard. It's a fun and interactive way to learn about event listeners and audio manipulation in JavaScript.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure of the drum kit application. Each drum element is represented by a `<div>` with a data attribute for the corresponding key code.
  
- **CSS:** The CSS file styles the drum kit application, providing visual feedback when keys are pressed.
  
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript file adds event listeners to detect key presses and plays the corresponding drum sound when a key is pressed. It also handles animations to visually indicate which drum is being played.

### How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Press the keys displayed on the screen or your keyboard to play the drum sounds.

## Day 2: JavaScript Clock

For the second day of the challenge, I created a JavaScript clock. This clock displays the current time with hour, minute, and second hands rotating accordingly. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of how JavaScript can be used to create dynamic and interactive content on web pages.

### Project Overview:

- **HTML:** The HTML file contains the structure of the clock, consisting of hour, minute, and second hands.
  
- **CSS:** The CSS file styles the clock, providing a visually appealing design with a background image and proper alignment of the clock hands.
  
- **JavaScript:** The JavaScript code updates the rotation of the clock hands every second to reflect the current time.

### How to Use:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Observe the clock hands moving to display the current time.
